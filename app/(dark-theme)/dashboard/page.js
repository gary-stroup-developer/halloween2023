        <p>
        Halloween is a holiday celebrated each year on October 31, and Halloween 2023 will 
        occur on Tuesday, October 31. The tradition originated with the ancient Celtic festival 
        of Samhain, when people would light bonfires and wear costumes to ward off ghosts. In the 
        eighth century, Pope Gregory III designated November 1 as a time to honor all saints. Soon, 
        All Saints Day incorporated some of the traditions of Samhain. The evening before was known 
        as All Hallows Eve, and later Halloween. Over time, Halloween evolved into a day of activities 
        like trick-or-treating, carving jack-o-lanterns, festive gatherings, donning costumes and eating 
        treats.
